<p>The magnificent stone fireplace at the DOCNC cabin was built in honor of one of the club's earliest supporters, Ray Taylor '11. The fireplace separates the main Common Room (dedicated to Winsor D. Wilkinson '10) from the kitchen and provides an unparalleled touch to the cabin.</p>

<p>Ray Taylor was born on August 14th, 1888 in Chicago and died on December 9th, 1952 while on a business trip to the East. He was a vice president of his college class and a past president of the Dartmouth Association of Northern California and Nevada, which was the precursor to today's San Francisco alumni club. Ray enthusiastically promoted the building of a far western outing club cabin. As a result, he was both a charter member and the first President of the Dartmouth Outing Club of Northern California, "thus nourishing the flame he helped to light in 1909 when his classmate Fred Harris founded the DOC in Hanover."</p>

<p>The fireplace was built in the summer of 1955 by a mason from the Tahoe area. President John Sloan Dickey led the dedication ceremony at the cabin on October 9, 1955. We're unsure who cast the bronze memorial plate. Ray's beautifully carved senior class cane also hangs above the fireplace mantle, along with that of Bob Allen '33. Members of the class of 1911 contributed funds for the fireplace.</p> 

<p>According to DOCNC records, the fireplace includes four "significant rocks." Three rocks are from the College grant and were obtained through Bob Monahan '29, the College forester at the time and a former member of the DOCNC. The fourth rock was contributed by Troy Parker '11 from the waste below the sculpture on Mt. Rushmore, South Dakota, which was still being built when Troy snuck off with his prize. Letters between the DOCNC secretary and Bob indicate that the DOCNC was interested in "getting some of those radioactive rocks you have found" for the fireplace, but we feel pretty certain that Geiger counters will test clean!</p>

<p>From DOCNC literature of the time: "Ray Taylor loved and lived for Dartmouth and was the epitome of the Dartmouth spirit and a proponent of her outdoor traditions. His memory lives on in a warm spot where Dartmouth sons (ED NOTE: and daughters!) gather to enjoy the warmth of companionship that Ray gave to all who cherish her."</p>

<p>This photo of Ray Taylor was taken at Bill Washburn's "shack" in South Lake Tahoe. From what we can tell from our records, the DOCNC founders spent a good amount of time at Dr. Washburn's house plotting and planning the DOCNC. This photo was chosen by Cora Taylor, Ray's wife, as one of her favorites.</p>
