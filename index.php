<p>Founded in 1939, the Dartmouth Outing Club of Northern California (DOCNC) is a group of Dartmouth alumni and alumnae interested in the great out-o-doors, mountain sports, conservation and good old College spirit. The DOCNC hosts events year-round in the Bay Area and is also the steward of an incredible cabin on the shores of Lake Mary on Donner Summit that is available for members to use. The DOCNC cabin is an incredible legacy of inestimable value to Dartmouth alumni and their families and friends.</p>
