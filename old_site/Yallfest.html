<P>When: Weekend of August 27th-29th, 1999</P>
<P>Who:  All interested D alums minted within the past 10 years</P>
<P>Where: The DOCNC Cabin in the Sierra</P>

<P>The big cabin weekend is fast approaching!</P>

<P>We've already received MANY responses. To better gauge exactly how big our weekend will be, we're asking everyone who is planning on attending to please let us know.</P>

<P>The purposes of this weekend at DOCNC's beautiful Donner Summit cabin are to get you out into them there woods, and to educate you a bit about the proper care, feeding, and historical background of our beloved cabin and the club which runs it.  Not only that, but you may find yourself learning a thing or three about the surrounding mountains, too!</P>

<P>Staying at the cabin will be FREE for the weekend. Food/Drink will be on a BYOF/BYOB basis and we hope it turns into something resembling a potluck smorgasbord.  (For more info on the cabin/etc., please check out </FONT><U><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff">http://www.alum.dartmouth.org/clubs/docnc/docnc.html</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>)</P>

<P>Please email Kevin and/or Jason if you plan on joining us for the cabin</P>
<P>weekend or if you have any questions.  More details to come to those who rsvp, otherwise this will be the last you'll get from us.</P>

<P>Hope to hear back from everyone!</P>
