<h2>Winter Water Procedures<br>Donner Pass Cabin</h2>
</center>
<br>
<h3>Turning the water ON:</h3><p>
To turn water <b>ON </b>upon arrival, do the following (in this order please!).
Before beginning please also read pages 3-4 to familiarize yourself with the
system design and for helpful tips and problem resolution.<p>
1. <b>Close hot and cold water taps</b> on the kitchen and porch
sinks.<p>
	2. <b>Close</b> the <b>two Green drain valves </b>under the kitchen sink. (turn clockwise)<p>
	3.  Turn <b>on </b>the main water <b>on/off lever</b> under the kitchen sink
by moving it 90 degrees to the <b>right </b>(counter clockwise).  (This lever is the <b>Silver</b> galvanized pipe.  It is an inverted "L" shaped pipe that goes through the floor and extends down to the below-ground shutoff and drain valve in the basement.)<p>
	4.  <b>Blue </b>valve under sink should already be open. (If the last party<p>
	followed shutdown procedures properly)<p>
	5.  <b>Open </b>hot water tap on kitchen sink to allow hot water tank to fill
	(Air will be forced from the system and you will hear the tank fill). When water runs from the tap, then the tank is full and you can close it.  Plug in the water heater <b>after</b> tank is full.<p>
	<b>You now should have water!  </b>

<h3>Summary of ON final positions: <p>
A.  Green valves closed.<br>
B.  Blue valve open.<br>
C.  Main ON (right).<br>
D.  Water heater plugged in.</h3>
</center>
<hr>
Note:  The <b>RED </b>valve that controls the cold source to the water
heater should always be OPEN.  The <b>Yellow </b>valves that control the porch lines (located below
and to the right of the sink) should also always be open in normal circumstances.<p>

<h3>Turning the water OFF:</h3><p>
	1.  Unplug the water heater!<p>
	2.  <b>Close</b> the <b>BLUE</b> valve under the kitchen sink. (Turn
clockwise)<p>
	3.  Turn <b>OFF </b>the <b>main water on/off lever</b> under the kitchen
sink. (Move the <b>Silver </b>handle 90 degrees to the left)<p>
	4.  <b>Open </b>both the <b>hot and cold taps on kitchen and porch
sinks</b>.<p>
	5.  <b>Open</b> the <b>two Green valves</b> under the kitchen sink. (Turn 
	counter-clockwise).   <b>Wait</b> until the entire system including 
	the hot water tank has drained. (approx. 5 minutes). <p>
	6.  <b>Open the BLUE valve</b> under the sink (turn counter-clockwise). 
 	Do this only after the hot water tank has fully drained.  This  
	allows the remaining standing column of water in the main 
	feed line to  drain through the below ground shutoff valve.)

<h3>Summary of OFF final positions:<p>
A. Water heater unplugged!<br>
B. Main on/off lever to left.<br>
C. Blue valve open.<br>
D. Green valves open.<br>
E. Sink taps open </h3>
<hr>
</center><p>
Note:  The <b>RED </b>valve that controls cold source to the water
heater should always be OPEN.  The <b>Yellow </b>valves that control the porch
lines (located below and to the right of the sink) should also always be on.
If any of these valves have been closed the system will not fully drain.<p>

<h3>Explanations:</h3><p>
The system is designed so that you can both turn it on and complete shutdown
all from under the kitchen sink.  The entire system, including the water
heater, is filled and drained each weekend to prevent frozen and burst pipes.<p>
<p>
<b>WATER HEATER</b><p>
The hot water heater has a pressure switch on its feed line that
will not allow the power to come on unless the system is pressurized.  This
prevents the element from burning out if the tank is empty.  It also means you
have to have the water ON to have the tank keep warm.  For this reason the tank
MUST BE DRAINED when leaving the cabin.  Further documentation on the water
heater is filed in the 'Cabin Use Instructions' book (blue, three ring binder)
kept next to the log books.<p>
<p>
<b>PUMP</b><p>
The pump is located in the pump room in the basement.  During winter it is kept
warm all the time by the presence of light bulbs that generate enough heat to
keep the temperature above freezing. These lights are on a separate circuit and
do not go off when the power is turned off.  You should not have to go into the
pump room for any reason, although in an emergency (pipes really frozen or
burst) water can also be drawn from the hose attached to a valve on top of the
pump.  Except for a complete failure of the pump, you can still get water, and
should never have to melt snow.  (The key to the pump room is in the
kitchen.)<p>
When running water, you will note from time to time that the red light next to
the breaker box in the commons room will come on, indicating that the pump is
running.  It should do so only long enough to bring the ballast tank up to
pressure.  If you note that the red light is on continually, and will not shut
off there is either a problem with the pump, or a you have running water (e.g.
an open drain valve, or burst line).  Please check immediately and if necessary
turn off the power to the pump only  (not to heating lights).<p>
<b>DRAINING THE SYSTEM</b><p>
It is important that the system be fully drained before departure to insure
that pipes do not freeze and burst.   The main water shutoff valve is located
below ground in a gravel drain box in the basement under the kitchen sink.
This valve is controlled by the on/off lever, which is  a galvanized pipe that
runs up to under the kitchen sink and turns 90 degrees left and right.   The
below ground valve allows remaining water to drain from the system into the
drainage box when the water is shut off.  The water line itself runs up through
a larger galvanized pipe sheath and goes to the blue secondary shutoff valve
under the sink.   <p>
The system is intended to be drained by allowing most of the water in the
copper feed lines and the hot water tank to flow outside the cabin in a
separate drain pipe from the sink system.   This is so as not to flood the
drain box below ground at the main shutoff.   For this reason it is important
to drain the standing water in the main feed  line last.   <b>Please follow the
procedures for turning the water off in the order specified to insure proper
drainage. </b><p>
<b>FROZEN PIPES</b><p>
Automatic Heat tapes have been installed on the porch lines, and also on
the main feed line coming up through the basement.  They should remain plugged
in at all times, and will only operate when a built-in thermostat tells them
temperature has dropped below freezing.<p>
In very cold weather there is still the slight chance that the pipes can
freeze.  Also if you let the cabin go completely cold while the system is
activated this risk is much greater.  If water does not flow after correctly
following the procedures listed, <b>please be patient.</b>  Open the taps and
wait.  The lines usually will thaw as the cabin warms and the heat tapes kick
in.  Open the doors under the kitchen sink to allow quicker warming.  <p>
If a pipe does burst most likely this would be in the porch sink system. It can
be isolated it by closing the two yellow valves, leaving the kitchen sink
operational.  Please report back any problems with the water system to the
reservations secretary.
