<h2>
Summer is perhaps the most restful season to visit the cabin.
The weather is almost always sunny and warm, with cool and invting
Lake Mary only a few feet away. Activities include hiking, mountain 
biking, swimming, canoeing, rock climbing, tanning, and, of course, 
sitting on the porch and watching the world go by...

In the summer of 1993 we added a canoe<br>
to our "fleet" of aquatic craft (see below).

Before the canoe, that piece of foam on the dock was all 
we had to sail<br> the waters of Lake Mary.
The foamship has since been retired,<br>but there have been 
recent sightings of intertubes.<br>Note Sugarbowl ski area in the background.
