<p><br><a NAME="Top"></a><b>Features &amp; Amenities</b>
<p>As you can tell from the floorplan, the top floor is for sleeping and
the bottom floor is for other activities. The cabin sleeps 12 in winter
and 15 in summer comfortably, and this is the number to which reservations
are limited on non-exclusive weekends. You can pack in more on exclusive
weekends, but you do so at your own discomfort, and we strongly discourage
it.
<p>The cabin is hardly rustic: it has wood heat, a full kitchen, electricity
&amp; lights, running water, a great dining table, couches and mattresses,
and an indoor chemical toilet.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SLEEPING
<blockquote>Bring a sleeping bag (and a sleeping pad if you would like
to sleep outdoors on the deck or beach). There are enough clean mattresses
for about a dozen folks.&nbsp; It can be quite cold in the cabin at night
during the snow season. Pillows are not provided. Tents are unnecessary.</blockquote>
GENERAL HANGING OUT
<blockquote>The living room has two couches, a CD player, a nice "comfy"
chair, and a great small desk and chair for reading/studying/working. There
are a slew of games and decks of cards too, and a few books. The cabin
journals, dating back decades, are always a great read. In the warm season,
the deck and the lakefront beach are great places to hang out.</blockquote>
HEAT
<blockquote>The cabin is stocked with sufficient wood -- you needn't bring
your own -- but you must bring more wood up from the basement for the next
group of folks and chop more kindling as well. Please read the Cabin Use
document for full details.</blockquote>
EXTRA THINGS OF NOTE FOR COLD SEASON
<blockquote>There is are several lines strung for drying out wet gear above
the wood-burning stove and a folding "shelved hanger thing" too. It can
get pretty cold at night, so be prepared. There's plenty of room to store
skis/snowshoes/etc. in the covered entryway of the front porch.</blockquote>

<p><br>SPORTS STUFF
<blockquote>Bring whatever sports equipment you need (e.g. climbing gear,
skis/skins, snowshoes, hiking boots, mountain bike, etc.). The cabin has
its own canoe with two lifejackets and paddles as well as a swell set of
horseshoes.</blockquote>
PHONE SERVICE
<blockquote>&nbsp;The cabin has a phone (530.426.0413) Please use it only
if really necessary. There is no answering machine or voice mail service,
and it is sometimes difficult for people in the cabin to hear the ringer.
When placing a call to the cabin, be sure to let the phone ring for a long
time before you give up. Do not make any long distance calls from this
phone that aren't collect or on a calling card. We will charge you the
fees plus a whopping service charge should you break this rule....</blockquote>
KITCHEN &amp; COOKING
<blockquote>The cabin has a full working kitchen, including a refrigerator/freezer,
stove, and a sink with running water.Cooking sets and utensils are unnecessary
as the kitchen is fully stocked with anything you'd need: plates, bowls,
cups, coffee filters and a pot, a small microwave, silverware, cooking
pans and pots, etc.&nbsp; The cabin also has two large plastic bins to
help with food storage (in addition to the cupboards). Only the&nbsp; tightly
shut bins can be guaranteed mice-free. We haven't had a bad problem with
mice in the cupboards recently, but it can happen.</blockquote>

<p><br>WEATHER
<blockquote>Plan on any combination of hot/sunny, thunderstorm, snowy,
or chilly/windy weather. The cabin is at 7000 feet elevation. See the weather
links on the home page for updated weather information.</blockquote>

<p><br>PETS
<blockquote>Pets are allowed, but please be sure to keep your pet(s) well-mannered
and respect anyone with allergies on non-exclusive weekends. Also, please
respect any requests regarding your pet(s) that might come from the neighbors.
There are a few other cabins on Lake Mary, and it's imperative that we
keep up good relations.</blockquote>
FIRE HAZARDS
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>We are extremely nervous about the possibilty of the cabin
somehow burning down due to negligence of a burning fire or candle. There
are a few candlesticks in the cabin. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH CANDLES.
DO NOT LEAVE THEM UNATTENDED.</blockquote>
NOISE
<blockquote>Please be mindful of neighbors in every way. We were taught
that at the College, right? Remember your manners.</blockquote>
