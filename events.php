<h3>Spring Work Weekend</h3>

<p>May or June, depending on snow levels

<p>Prep the cabin for the summer season. Mount the deck, float the dock, and store away those storm windows. Come up Friday night or Saturday morning. We get most of the work done on Saturday and then sit down to a big family-style dinner on Saturday night. Sunday there should be plenty of time for R&R. Food and lodging free for the weekend.

<h3>Fall Work Weekend</h3>

<p>2nd weekend of October

<p>Join the crew for getting the cabin ready for what we always hope will be a snow-abundant winter season. Free food and lodging for members and friends. This is a great time to meet your fellow DOCNC members and learn the ins and outs of cabin use
and maintenance.  <a

<h3>Winter Carnival West</h3>

<p>Always the first weekend in March. 

<p>This age-old College tradition has been adapted California-style:
crazy costumes, big air, and Pink Time Happy Hour on the lake are not to
be missed!
